# Food Delivery Management Project

## üìÑ Description
This project manages the process of food delivery orders using a MongoDB database. It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for client, product, order, employee, and store data, facilitating the management and traceability of orders made by customers.

### Features
1. **Database Connection:**
    - MongoDB is used to manage collections related to orders, clients, products, employees, and stores.
2. **Data Model:**
    - **Client:**
        - Contains basic client information (name, address, phone number, etc.).
    - **Product:**
        - Includes details about the products (name, description, category, price, etc.).
    - **Order:**
        - Each order contains details about the food ordered, delivery type (home or pickup), and the relationships with the client, store, and employee who managed it.
    - **Employee:**
        - Information about the employees managing the orders (name, role, assigned store).
    - **Store:**
        - Each store manages several orders and products.
3. **Queries:**
    - Queries to retrieve clients, products, stores, and employees.
    - Complex queries, such as retrieving all orders associated with a specific client or store.

4. **Relationships:**
    - **Client and Order:** One client can place many orders.
    - **Order and Product:** An order can contain multiple products.
    - **Product and Store:** A product belongs to a store.
    - **Employee and Order:** Each order has an employee responsible for it.

## üîß Running the Project
1. Ensure the database is set up properly in MongoDB.
2. Run the Main.java file to insert initial data and test CRUD operations for clients, products, and orders.
3. Check that the collections and documents are created correctly and that queries return expected results.

---

## üìà Architecture
### Repository
- The repository handles the direct CRUD operations on the database.
- Methods like insertClient, insertProduct, insertOrder, findClientById, etc., manage interactions with MongoDB.

### Services
- **Each service focuses on a specific set of operations for an entity:**
  - ClientService: Manages client creation, reading, updating, and deletion.
  - ProductService: Manages products available for orders.
  - OrderService: Handles the orders placed by clients.


- **Services delegate CRUD operations to repositories.**

## ‚ú® Additional Features
The model is scalable and allows for the addition of future features like:
- Order and client analysis.
- Inventory management for products.
- Sales report generation.

## üìù Project Structure
### Models
1. **Client:** Represents a client with fields like name, address, phone number, and others.
2. **Product:** Represents a product with fields like name, description, category, and others.
3. **Order:** Represents an order placed by a client, with details like delivery type, products ordered, total price, and others.
4. **Employee:** Represents an employee who handles orders, with fields like name, phone number, and role (delivery or cook).
5. **Store:** Represents a store that manages products and orders.

### Repositories
- **DatabaseRepository:** Handles CRUD operations directly with the database.
  - Methods like **insertClient**, **insertProduct**, **insertOrder** **handle insertions**, **updates**, and queries for entities.

### Services
- **ClientService**: Manages client-related operations, including creation, updates, and deletions, using repository methods.
- **ProductService**: Handles product-related operations, such as adding, updating, and querying products, with repository interaction.
   - **Category validation**: Validates the category of products. A predefined set of valid categories is used (`"pizza"`, `"hamburguesa"`, `"bebida"`).
- **OrderService**: Manages orders placed by clients, ensuring proper relationships between clients, products, and employees.
- **StoreService**: Manages store-related operations, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting stores.
- **EmployeeService**: Manages employee-related operations, such as handling employee records, assignments, and queries.

**All services follow the same pattern:**
1. **CRUD operations**: All entities (store, product, order, employee, and client) have their respective service handling creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion through methods in the service layer.
2. **Error handling**: Each service ensures proper error handling during database operations, printing relevant messages when issues occur.
3. **Repository interaction**: The services delegate the actual CRUD operations to the `DatabaseRepository`, which directly interacts with the MongoDB database, maintaining the separation of concerns.



### DataSeeder Class

The **DataSeeder** class is responsible for seeding the database with sample data, making it ready for use. It interacts with the service layer to add clients, products, stores, employees, and orders.

- **Client Creation**: A new client is created and inserted into the database using `ClientService`.
- **Store Creation**: A new store is created and inserted into the database using `StoreService`.
- **Product Creation**: A product is created with a reference to the `storeId` of the newly created store, and added using `ProductService`.
- **Employee Creation**: An employee is created and associated with the store, and added using `EmployeeService`.
- **Order Creation**: An order is created and linked to a specific client and store. It includes details of the products ordered, the employee who processed it, and other relevant information. This order is inserted using `OrderService`.

#### **Key Functions in DataSeeder**:
1. **Store, Client, Product, and Employee Creation**: Creates instances of each entity, passing the necessary data (including relationships like `storeId` for products and employees).
2. **Order Creation**: An order is created, linking it to the created client, store, and employee, and inserted into the database.
3. **Service Utilization**: Leverages service methods to interact with the database, ensuring business logic is followed and separation of concerns is maintained.

## üìà Workflow
1. Clients place orders, which are registered in the system as Order entities.
2. The products available are managed by the Product entity.
3. Stores manage products and orders, while employees are responsible for fulfilling the orders.
4. Data integrity is ensured through validations in both the services and repositories.

## üìå Conclusion
This project provides a modular, flexible, and scalable structure for managing food delivery orders. Using MongoDB to store data, it allows for efficient querying and maintains a clear flow of relationships between clients, products, orders, employees, and stores.
